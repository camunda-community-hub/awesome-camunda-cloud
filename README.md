## Clients And Programing Framework Integrations

*Client libraries to interact with Zeebe*

- [Java](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/tree/master/clients/java)
  - [Spring](https://github.com/zeebe-io/spring-zeebe)
- [Go](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/tree/master/clients/go)
- [C#](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp)
- [Delphi](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/DelphiZeeBeClient)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-client-ruby)
  - [Beez](https://github.com/gottfrois/beez) - Simple, efficient ruby workers for Zeebe
- [Node.js](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js)
  - [NestJS](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/nestjs-zeebe#readme)
- [Rust](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebest)
- Python:
  - [Zeebe Python gRPC](https://pypi.org/project/zeebe-grpc/)
  - [Pyzeebe](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/pyzeebe)
- [WorkIt](https://github.com/VilledeMontreal/workit) - Node.js (TypeScript) client for both Zeebe and Camunda BPM platforms

_**Want an exporter for another language?**_

Thanks to gRPC you can generate client stubs easily as described in [Generating a Zeebe-Python Client Stub in Less Than An Hour: A gRPC + Zeebe Tutorial](https://camunda.com/blog/2018/11/grpc-generating-a-zeebe-python-client/).


## Connectors and Bridges

*Connector: A piece of software that connects Zeebe with some other system or infrastructure. Might be uni or bidirectional and possibly includes a job worker.*

- [Kafka Connector](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/kafka-connect-zeebe)
- [HTTP](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-http-worker) - Zeebe job worker for making HTTP calls
- [Lambda](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-lambda-worker) - A Zeebe worker to invoke AWS Lambdas (Serverless functions), allowing to orchestrate functions
- [Node-RED Zeebe nodes](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/node-red-contrib-zeebe)
- [Zeebe GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zeebe-action) - Integrate Zeebe into GitHub Workflows with Camunda Cloud

## Job Workers

*Job Worker: A special type of client that polls for and executes available jobs. In contrast to connectors and bridges, such workers do not connect to other active pieces of software primarily (for example, a 'DMN Connector' might connect Zeebe to a managed DMN Engine, a 'DMN worker' will use a DMN library to execute decisions).*

- [Script](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-script-worker) - Zeebe job worker for evaluating JS, Groovy, and FEEL scripts
- [DMN Scala](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/dmn-scala/tree/master/zeebe-worker) - Zeebe job worker using the [Scala DMN engine](https://github.com/camunda/dmn-scala)
- [Camunda DMN](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-dmn-worker) - Zeebe job worker using the [Camunda DMN engine](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-engine-dmn)

## Exporters

*Exporters to load data into external systems*

- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/tree/master/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter)
- [Event Store](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-eventstore-exporter)
- [Hazelcast](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter)
