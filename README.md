A curated list of awesome [Camunda Cloud](https://camunda.io) projects, mostly driven by the community. Inspired by [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go).

Previously this list contained only Zeebe awesome-ness. Help us collect all things awesome about Camunda Cloud and Zeebe, the workflow engine powering Camunda Cloud.

- [WorkIt](https://github.com/VilledeMontreal/workit) - Node.js (TypeScript) client for both Zeebe and Camunda BPM platforms (Not updated for Zeebe 1.0.0)

**Want a client for another language?**

Thanks to gRPC you can generate client stubs easily as described in [Generating a Zeebe-Python Client Stub in Less Than An Hour: A gRPC + Zeebe Tutorial](https://camunda.com/blog/2018/11/grpc-generating-a-zeebe-python-client/).


## Connectors and Bridges

Connector: A piece of software that connects Camunda Cloud or Zeebe with some other system or infrastructure. Might be uni or bidirectional and possibly includes a job worker.

- [Kafka Connector](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/kafka-connect-zeebe)
- [HTTP](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-http-worker) - Zeebe job worker for making HTTP calls
- [Lambda](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-lambda-worker) - A Zeebe worker to invoke AWS Lambdas (Serverless functions), allowing to orchestrate functions
- [Node-RED Zeebe nodes](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/node-red-contrib-zeebe)
- [Zeebe GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zeebe-action) - Integrate Zeebe into GitHub Workflows with Camunda Cloud

## Job Workers

Job Worker: A special type of client that polls for and executes available jobs. In contrast to connectors and bridges, such workers do not connect to other active pieces of software primarily (for example, a 'DMN Connector' might connect Zeebe to a managed DMN Engine, a 'DMN worker' will use a DMN library to execute decisions).

- [Script](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-script-worker) - Zeebe job worker for evaluating JS, Groovy, Kotlin and FEEL scripts
- [DMN Scala](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/dmn-scala/tree/master/zeebe-worker) - Zeebe job worker using the [Scala DMN engine](https://github.com/camunda/dmn-scala)
- [Camunda DMN](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-dmn-worker) - Zeebe job worker using the [Camunda DMN engine](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-engine-dmn)
- [Zeebe Slack Worker](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-slack-worker) - A Node.js library for building job workers that send messages to Slack based on service tasks.

## Exporters

Exporters to load data into external systems, only available with Camunda Cloud Self-Managed.

- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/tree/master/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter)
- [Event Store](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-eventstore-exporter)
- [Hazelcast](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-hazelcast-exporter)
- [Incident Alerter (Webhook)](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-incident-alerter)
- [Kafka](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-kafka-exporter)
- [CSV](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-csv-exporter)
- [NATS Streaming Server](https://github.com/MrSaints/zeebe-nats-streaming-exporter)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/crossid/zeebe-mongo-exporter)

**Want an exporter for another system?**

You can build one in as little as 15 minutes. Take a look at the [Zeebe Exporter Demo](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-exporter-demo), and the tutorial blog posts [Part One](https://zeebe.io/blog/2019/05/exporter-part-1/) and [Part Two](https://zeebe.io/blog/2019/05/exporter-part-2/).
